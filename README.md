Tonis
=====

Tonis is a PSR-7 micro-framework that can also be used as MVC middleware. Tonis was built for flexibility and performance
while still having the modularity of larger frameworks. Tonis features an event-driven architecture that allows you to 
easily customize the entire life-cycle for micro-services, apis, or even full on sites.

Tonis is built with best practices in mind and features 100% unit test coverage, integration tests, and high quality code.
